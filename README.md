Social-Integration-in-iOS
=========================
Its a ready-made social sign in integration in a single application using Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

I used 

1. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/ for Facebook

2. https://github.com/nst/STTwitter for Twitter 

3. https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFOAuth1Client for LinkedIn

I know its already in the Github and Facebook. But,its for those who are unaware of cocoapods or doesn’t want to use cocoapods or those who don’t have the time to download each of them individually and then integrate it into a single application. Isn’t that great?

Thanks to Mattt Thompson and Nicolas Seriot. Sorry………thank you Facebook!
